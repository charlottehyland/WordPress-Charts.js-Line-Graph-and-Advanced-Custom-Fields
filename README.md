Wordpress Code Snippet: using Charts.js and Advanced Custom Fields to have website charts that can be easily edited in the WordPress back-end.

<strong>Dependencies:</strong>
<ul>
   <li>Advanced Custom Fields plugin installed and activated in WordPress</li>
   <li>A repeater field with a number sub-field created in ACF</li>
   <li>Chart.js installed, in this example I'm using Chart.js 2.5.0</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin: 10px auto;"><img src="http://charlottehyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/acf-field.png"/></div>
<br/>

In this example, we have a line graph with two lines that is referencing data points from an ACF repeater number sub-field to display the chart.

Here's the final product, please note, this snippet only shows how to build out the chart, not how to add the caption:<br/>
<div style="margin: 10px auto;"><img src="http://charlottehyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/line-graph.png"/></div>
